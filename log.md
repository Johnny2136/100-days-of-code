# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp and did one project.

**Thoughts** II've had many coding classes in college and want to step up my game, I found out that coding is not like riding a bike you don’t just learn it and then know it from now on, I don’t code at work so my skills rusted up quite a bit. I want to revamp them and try and stay current with modern technology I started following students of [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/) in Scotland and found Free Code Camp so I’m working through the course ware and once done hope to contribute to the project, and it's an awesome feeling when I finally solve an exercise challenge after a lot of failing unit tests that green banner appears and it’s like “YEEEESSSS!!!!!!”.

  ### Day 2: July 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the remaining exercises on FreeCodeCamp Debugging Project.

**Thoughts** I've had a lot of experiance debugging so was able to get though all the excersizes a couple we pretty tricky.
```javascript
//Debugging: Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop
// original buggy code...

function zeroArray(m, n) {
  // Creates a 2-D array with m rows and n columns of zeroes
  let newArray = [];
  let row = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    // Adds the m-th row into newArray
    /**** //the offending code Loop****
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      // Pushes n zeroes into the current row to create the columns
      row.push(0);
    }
    */
    // Pushes the current row, which now has n zeroes in it, to the array
    newArray.push(row);
  }
  for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) { //my solution move outside first loop
      // Pushes n zeroes into the current row to create the columns
      row.push(0);
    }
  return newArray;
}
let matrix = zeroArray(3, 2);
console.log(matrix);
```
