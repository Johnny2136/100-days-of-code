**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: July 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through ____ exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** II've had many coding classes in college and want to step up my game, I found out that coding is not like riding a bike you don’t just learn it and then know it from now on, I don’t code at work so my skills rusted up quite a bit. I want to revamp them and try and stay current with modern technology I started following students of [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/) in Scotland and found Free Code Camp so I’m working through the course ware and once done hope to contribute to the project, and it's an awesome feeling when I finally solve an exercise challenge after a lot of failing unit tests that green banner appears and it’s like “YEEEESSSS!!!!!!”.
